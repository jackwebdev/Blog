I have a huge passion for technology. I've grown up with the likes of the Internet and modern technology and seen how quick it evolves year on year. I remember the first iPhone never had an App Store as Steve Jobs favoured Web Apps instead. Though we all know the App Store boomed when they announced it a year later. The Web platform has the biggest global reach and can work on almost any smart device.

I've played around with the Web over the years and towards the end of 2017 I decided to take the dive and learn Web Development, specifically Front-End development. Since playing with my first video-games and iPhone apps, I've always wanted to learn and figure out how they work. I started a basic BlogSpot blog when Club Penguin was in it's prime and shared the latest News and Cheats. I used to look through the Developer Console to figure out how the game would work on my browser and mostly seeing how their website Front was with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, though it was all still very new to me and I didn't understand any of it.

I enjoyed creating and customising blogs from my childhood, it sparked excitement when I can see something change on my screen. It would spark a flame inside me that I can actually do this! During my early years of secondary school, I always wanted to learn to programming, but never had the opportunity even in College we only had 1 lesson learning Game Maker Language, I was, however, able to pick up the basics of HTML from Game Blogs, not being a real programming language it kept me inspired. We had a few lessons in secondary school using Serif's WebPlus software which I excelled with from my Blogs expierence.  It wasn't until 2018 where I dived deeper into the Web and really got going with CSS / JavaScript.
