It's a brand new year, it's time for a new Blog! Towards the start of this year I have decided to read the Jekyll docs and learn how to create a Blog from scratch. I have also figured out how to style this blog.

At this point I'm still learning so things may not be 100% right, but I'm learning.

### The point of this blog
I've managed blogs in the past and I've read many other blogs from tutorials to tech news. I found it very useful logging what I was learning on certain days. It reminds me to explain in short what I've learnt.

I have since removed my old posts and will aim to document big learning curves, which will be more tutorial based. I can then use my own Blog to reference back. I have been note taking, but I'm now confident to start creating Blog entries.
